# Measuring Market Uncertainty: Using Shannon Entropy to Detect Stock Price Volatility

#### Group: Tate Middleton, Harrison Getches, Max Bradbury, Blake Zimmerman

##### Abstract: Our group aims to use historical stock data to predict stock price or market volatility. To do this, we plan to use machine learning and Shannon Entropy to calculate market entropy in a given time period. In this process, high entropy will signify high volatility or uncertainty in the market, while low volatility signifies a more stable market or stock. To check the accuracy of the model, we will compare with previous unstable times in the stock market and check to see if our model makes accurate predictions. Further, we will try and apply the model to the current market, and see if it can make accurate predictions on untested (future) data. This sort of financial modeling has implications for quantitative finance in fields such as risk management, and general banking and investment.
